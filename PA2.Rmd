The following libraries will be used in the analysis 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(chron)
```

* **plyr**: will be used to manipulate datas
* **ggplot2**: will be used for some of the plot
* **chron**: will be used to discriminate between weekdays and weekends

I will suppose that the required project has been cloned in the home 
directory of a linux machine; otherwise the proper working directory should be inserted below

```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("~/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
The data are contained in a compressed file; I have to uncompress it and to load it. I will specify the NA string too.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip")

activity <- read.csv2("activity.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")
```
