The following libraries will be used in the analysis 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

* **plyr**: will be used to manipulate datas
* **ggplot2**: will be used for some of the plot

I will suppose that the required project has been cloned in the home 
directory of a linux machine; otherwise the proper working directory should be inserted below

```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("~/RepData_PeerAssessment2")
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
If they are not locally stored I download the required files: 

* the data file
* the documentation file
* the FAQ file
